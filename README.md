<h2>Cloning the repository</h2>

To clone this repository to your local machine, run the following command in your terminal:

```git clone https://github.com/VincenzoPresta/AI_Planning_Assignment_Fortugno_Greco_Presta.git```

This will create a new directory called competizioneIA2024 on your computer. You can then change into this directory and start working on the code.

<h2>Make changes</h2>
To ensure you're working on the correct branch, follow these steps:
  
  1. Identify the branch you want to work on: Determine the specific branch you need to access or contribute to. This branch might be named based on a feature, task, or bug fix.
  
  2. Check the current branch: Use the "git branch" command to view the list of available branches and identify the currently active branch. The active branch will be highlighted or marked with an asterisk (*).

<h3>Switch to the desired branch</h3>

To switch to the desired branch, use the "git checkout" command followed by the branch name:

```git checkout <branch-name>```

Verify the branch change: After switching branches, re-run the "git branch" command to confirm that you're now on the correct branch.

```git branch```

<h3>Pushing changes</h3>  
If you make changes to the code that you want to share with others, you can push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub. To do this, run the following commands in your terminal:

```
git add .
git commit -m "[Your commit message]"
git push origin main
```
This will add all of the changed files to the staging area, commit them with a message, and push them to the master branch of the remote repository.
